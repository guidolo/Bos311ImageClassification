# Bos311ImageClassification

This is a simple examples to compare two images classification methods: 
	Eigenimages (generalization of engenfaces)
	Neural Networks (just a plain NN). 

Prerequisites:
	TensorFlow 
	Sckit-learn

Content:  
	ImageProcessing  
		311Image download.py 	--> a small web crawling with the code to download the images from Boston 311 repository  
		ImageProcessing.py 		--> all the functionality to load in memory and manipulate images  
  
	NeuralNet Lab  
		NN5L.py --> Definition of a function that run a 5 leyer NeuralNetwork.
	
	SVM Lab
		SVM.py 	--> Definition of a funtion to run Eigenimages

	Main-NN5L.ipynb --> Jupyter Notebook with the call of the NN function
	Main-SVN.ipynb 	--> Jupyter Notebook with the call to the Eigenimages clasification funtion
